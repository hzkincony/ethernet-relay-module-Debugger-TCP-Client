In the debugger, we demonstrate how to control the single relay switch, how to control “ALL ON”, “ALL OFF” with one button, how to control the specified relay switch, how to read the current state of one relay switch, how to read the current state of all relay switches at one time, and how to read the dry node sensor state connected at the input port of controller. The bottom left of the window is the content of “send buffer”; the bottom right of the window is the content of “receive buffer”. Before use, set the server’s “ip” and “port” , then click the “Connect” button to connection with controller.

In the VirCom network configuration tool, set the KC868-Hx controller  “Work Mode” to “TCP Server”. At this time, the KC868-Hx controller is the server, and the PC debugger is the client. The controller is in “Listening” state. After click “Connect” button on PC debugger, it will establish a socket communication connection with the controller to realize data interaction.
